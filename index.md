    title: About
    text: >+
     As an award-winning, Director of Product and Platform Engineering I have an extensive background with progressive roles leading and supporting the creation of innovative, consumer facing products, improving product and brand performance in global markets while generating millions in new business revenue for global companies.

      Throughout my career, my analytical skills as an engineer have combined with my passion to create a world where technology can empower everyone to thrive, championing the customer. This drive for tech began when I got my first computer at age 5, a Commodore 64. I learned to code in 3 months at a boot camp after college and the love affair began.

      My leadership style is empowering and collaborative, bringing others along through communicating technical solutions clearly and easily, even for non-techies. I provide mentoring and lead all diversity and inclusion efforts, demonstrated by founding Women@Siri and launching the Tile mentorship program, which gained 67% participation.
